# Browser Hub (Firefox Extension)

7 in 1 Button Hub. Users of userChrome will appreciate this. Very simple browser functions from 1 small button.

New Tab - New Window - New Private Window - Fullscreen button - Open Profile folder - Close Current tab - Undo Closed Tab

Im very much an amateur with JS, but I can confidently say every function works for Firefox Instances. But unsure on Open Profile Folder Button with Chrome Browser.
- ~~side note, opening a new private* window will not work when sideloading this extension. It works on  DEV edition, ESR, Nightly, and the non-Mozilla Firefox forks.~~
- ~~Default Release wont let me bypass the permission until the extension is approved by MOZ Add On reviewer.~~
- ~~Will update when it onto add on store.~~
- Approved and published to the add on store. https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/browser-hub/
- Free to use. Free to fork.
