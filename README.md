#Browser Hub (Firefox Extension)

7 in 1 Button Hub. Users of userChrome will appreciate this. Very simple browser functions from 1 small button.

New Tab - New Window - New Private Window - Fullscreen button - Open Profile folder - Close Current tab - Undo Closed Tab



Im very much an amateur with JS, but I can confidently say every function works for Firefox Instances. Possibly chrome, but unsure on Open Profile Folder Button.
