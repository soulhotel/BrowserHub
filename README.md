# Browser Hub (Firefox Extension)

7 in 1 Button Hub. Users of userChrome will appreciate this. Very simple browser functions from 1 small button.

New Tab - New Window - New Private Window - Fullscreen button - Open Profile folder - Close Current tab - Undo Closed Tab

Im very much an amateur with JS, but I can confidently say every function works for Firefox Instances. But unsure on Open Profile Folder Button with Chrome Browser.
- side note, opening a new private* window will not work when sideloading this extension. It works on  DEV edition, ESR, Nightly, and the non-Mozilla Firefox forks.
- Default Release wont let me bypass the permission until the extension is approved by MOZ Add On reviewer.
- Currently waiting.

Open Private Window, Undo Closed tabs, everything good on DEV edition of FF:

Free for use. Will update if I get it onto addon store.
